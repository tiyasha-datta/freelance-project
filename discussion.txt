TT till may 24 - this sheet contains the fleet details master data - FMS?

Harpreet singh sabharwal - how to filter this sheet for trip calculations - TMS? what should be there in the trip master data, not trip table(details coming from frontend) 

trip master data
fleet master data
trip table - data stored from frontend and calculated fare

keeping one database for all, with multiple tables - fleet -> fleet details, freight rate, trip -> trip details with calculation of fare 
batch database call
add swagger
add postman collection
add exception handling
add logging
* learn cache
interaction betwwen two microservices - fleet and trip
write the logic for calculation
freight rate stored in database, where?


calculation:

standard KM * 2 = RTKM
capacity of fleet * RTKM * freight rate = fare of each trip

standard km - can be found in "Harpreet singh sabharwal" trip sheet?
capacity of fleet - "TT till may 24" sheet - truck master data?
the rate of trip for per KL and KM - taken from screenshot - that should be stored in freight rate table? 


ex:
	TT - HR37B0021
	capacity - 24.00 
	standard km - 394
	RTKM - 394 * 2 = 788
	fare of trip : 
		upto 49RTKM for 24KL = 123(per KL) * 24KL  = 2952/-
		for next (788RTKM - 49RTKM = 739RTKM) for 24KL = 2.1301(per KLKM) * 739RTKM * 24KL = 37,779.45
		total trip fare - 40,731.45/- -> this should be entered against  each trip in the TMS (trip table)
		
		
		
will freight rate be changed?
